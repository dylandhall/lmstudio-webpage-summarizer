# Note

## Updates to this fork

Original readme below - this project has now been very heavily modified. It supports:

* Customising your prompts and model
* Saving state if the popup is closed/opened
* Automatic reconnects and state handling if chrome closes the background service
* Chat interface to ask questions about the article
* Rolling chat window to continue conversation

Note, a lot of this was done as an experiment with AI generated code. It falls WELL below the standard for anything I'd write myself but it's working and that's impressive. I'm not sure it saved time in the long run but it was a fun experiment.

# Local Web Page Summarizer Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension provides a convenient way to summarize the content of web pages directly from your browser. Utilizing a local API that simulates the OpenAI API through LM Studio, this extension fetches and displays summaries quickly, helping users to grasp the essential content without reading the entire text.

## Features

- **Web Page Summarization:** Extracts and summarizes the text from any webpage, excluding non-essential elements like ads, headers, and footers.
- **Real-time Streaming:** Handles JSON streams for real-time summarization responses from a local API.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eddieoz/lmstudio-webpage-summarizer.git
   ```

2. **Load the extension in Chrome:**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
